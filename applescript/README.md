# Rock, Paper, Scissors (AppleScript)

This is an implementation of a simple rock, paper, scissors app in AppleScript.

## Installation

AppleScript is built into the OSX operating system and cannot be run on any other
OS.

## Compilation

No compilation is necessary.

## Syntax

There are two ways to run an AppleScript. The first is to open the `.scpt` file
using Finder, which will likely open up the AppleScript editor. From there, 
clicking the Play icon will run the script.

To run the script directly without opening up the AppleScript editor, open up a
terminal, navigate to the current directory, and run the following command:

```
osascript rps.scpt
```
